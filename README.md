# orgchart
Drag and drop org chart, [see it in action here!](https://gregbabcock.github.io/orgchart/) The intent is to create an org chart canvas and drag onto it the various roles that comprise your company structure. Once a role is on the canvas you would have the ability to assign people within the organization to a particular role. Roles can be added, removed, assigned to a person, placed on the canvas but unassigned to a person, re-assigned to another person or dragged onto another role to become its child along with all other children that were assigned to the role being dragged.
And for future consideration, this is a great example of a responsive three-panel app using angular (click on the chat feature for the right panel) (http://mobileangularui.com/demo/#/)
